  /// The following code will print:

## Features and Limitations
This library follows the [JsonPath] internet draft specification. Since the spec itself is 
an evolving document, this implementation may lag behind, and some features may not be implemented in-full.
Please refer to the tests (there are hundreds of them, including the [CTS]) to see what is supported.

Currently supported built-in functions:
- `length()`
- `count()`
- `match()`
- `search()`


## Data manipulation
Each `Node` produced by the `.read()` method contains the `.pointer` property which is a valid [JSON Pointer]
and can be used to alter the referenced value. If you only need to manipulate JSON data, 
check out my [JSON Pointer implementation].

## User-defined functions (_beta_)

The JSONPath parser may be extended by user-defined functions. The user-defined functions
take precedence over the built-in ones which are defined by the standard. The functions
are polymorphic: you may define functions with the same name, and the parser will pick the first
of them which fits the use case (the return type, the number and the type or arguments).
